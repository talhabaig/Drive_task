## Product description

Our project aims to create a user-friendly interface for organizing files and folders. Users will have the ability to add folders and files, delete them, and edit their contents seamlessly. 

Folder Functionality:

Add Folder: Users can click on a designated area to add a new folder. This action will prompt them to enter a name for the folder, and upon confirmation, the folder will be created.
Delete Folder: Users will have the option to delete a folder by clicking on a delete button or icon associated with the folder. A confirmation dialog box may appear to prevent accidental deletion.
Edit Folder: To edit a folder's name, users can click on the folder name itself, triggering an editable field where they can make changes. Upon confirmation or clicking outside the field, the changes will be saved.
File Functionality:

Add File: Similarly, users can click on a designated area to add a new file. This action will prompt them to upload a file from their device. After selecting the file, users may also enter a name for it before confirming the addition.
Delete File: Users will have the option to delete a file by clicking on a delete button or icon associated with the file. As with folder deletion, a confirmation dialog box may appear.
Edit File: To edit a file's name or contents, users can click on the file name or content area, respectively. This action will enable an editable field where they can make changes. Upon confirmation or clicking outside the field, the changes will be saved.
